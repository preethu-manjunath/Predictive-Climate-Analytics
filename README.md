## 📌 Overview  

Predictive Climate Analytics focuses on applying **data-driven methodologies** to understand and forecast climate variability and its impact. The project integrates **machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), and statistical modeling** with climate science to generate meaningful insights for environmental decision-making.  

## 🔥 Key Focus Areas  

- **Hydroclimate Modeling:** Understanding precipitation patterns and water availability.  
- **Extreme Weather Prediction:** Identifying and forecasting climate extremes.  
- **Climate Variability Analysis:** Studying long-term climate trends and their implications.  
- **AI & ML in Climate Science:** Leveraging machine learning for predictive analytics in climate research.  

## 🔧 Methodologies  

The project employs a combination of:  

- **Time-Series Forecasting** (LSTMs, ARIMA, Prophet)  
- **Geospatial Analysis** (GIS, Remote Sensing)  
- **Deep Learning Models** (CNNs, RNNs for weather pattern recognition)  
- **Statistical Climatology** (PCA, EOF Analysis)  
- **Big Data Processing** (Hadoop, Spark for climate data analysis)
